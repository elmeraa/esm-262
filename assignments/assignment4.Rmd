```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
fish_data <- read.table("data/fish.txt",
                        header = TRUE) %>% 
  rename("species" = x) %>% 
  drop_na() 

fish_factor <- as.factor(fish_data$species)
# head(fish_factor) this should be better now

summary(fish_factor)

source("R/fish_fun.R")
fish_summary <- fish_fun(species = fish_factor)
fish_summary  # she mentioned to find the total number of fish so I think just doing total = sum(summary(species)) works in the function and not length.

## next, include an option (defaulted to FALSE) that if TRUE also returns a histogram of the number of each fish type, with a title giving the total number of fish caught. Remember that you can save a graph as a variable.
